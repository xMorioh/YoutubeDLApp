**About this Project**

The Goal is to make a lightweight Youtube Downloader with a GUI as Windows Application.
<br>
This Project is mostly for me to learn how to create Desktop Applications and to learn and use more C# in combinationwith .NET as well as Visual Studio in combination with Github.


**Application Features**:
* Automatically downloads the latest [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) files as dependencies
* Choose between Video and Audio
* Include Playlist if needed
* Set different directory Outputs for Video and Audio
* Set custom yt-dlp Attributes if needed
* Offers a Debug Window and a quick dependencie update Button
<br>

Since this GUI just transfers input to yt-dlp there should be no restrictions on what yt-dlp supports including not just Youtube but also Twitter/X and the entire list noted [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#extractor-arguments) even despite the Name of this application it is much more flexible than it seems.
