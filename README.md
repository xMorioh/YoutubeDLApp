**About this Project**

The Goal is to make a lightweight Youtube Downloader with a GUI as Windows Application.
<br>
This Project is mostly for me to learn how to create Desktop Applications and to learn and use more C# in combinationwith .NET as well as Visual Studio in combination with Github.


**Application Features**:
* Automatically downloads the latest [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) files as dependencies
* Choose between Video and Audio
* Include Playlist if needed
* Set different directory Outputs for Video and Audio
